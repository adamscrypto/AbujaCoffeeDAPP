 ## Project Description
 
Abuja Coffee DApp – Buy Me a Coffee on the Blockchain

Abuja Coffee DApp is a decentralized application that lets users "buy you a coffee" using Ethereum. Built with Hardhat, React, JavaScript, and MetaMask integration, it demonstrates full-stack blockchain development—from smart contracts to a user-friendly frontend.


## Features
* Ethereum smart contract for accepting coffee payments (tips/donations)
* React frontend with MetaMask wallet integration
* Secure blockchain transactions
* Transaction history of coffee purchases
* Local blockchain testing and deployment using Hardhat

## Technologies Used

* Hardhat – smart contract development, local blockchain
* Solidity – Ethereum smart contracts
* React – modern frontend framework
* JavaScript – core app logic
* Ethers.js – communication with Ethereum network
* MetaMask – user wallet connection and transaction signing


## Purpose

Abuja Coffee DApp showcases:

* Blockchain-based tipping and donation systems
* End-to-end Ethereum DApp development
* Integration of smart contracts with a React frontend
* Real-world wallet connection and user transaction flows via MetaMask

It’s built for my developer portfolio to demonstrate practical blockchain skills.


##  Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/abuja-coffee-dapp.git
cd abuja-coffee-dapp
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run local blockchain (Hardhat node):

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

Deploy contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

* Connect your MetaMask wallet to the DApp.
* Select the amount of "coffee" (Ethereum tip) you want to send.
* Confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
* View the transaction history and messages from supporters.
